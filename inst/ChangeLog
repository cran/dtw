        Documentation twaks for consistency with Python (dtw-python)

1.21-2
        Migrate to markdown documentation.

1.21-1
        Migrate to roxygen; remove triangle fixing algorithm.

1.20-1
        Move to init.c registration style

1.19-2
        Fixed dtw-package.Rd with macros

1.19-1
        Added triangle inequality fixing algorithm

1.18-2
        Speedup in C code

1.18-1
        Compliant with new CRAN checks

1.18
	Added index1s, index2s properties: backtrack skipping intermediate
	steps

1.17-1
	Moved vignette and other updates for R-3.1.0.  Step patterns
	symmetric1 and symmetric2 have been reordered so that they prefer
	the diagonal step in case of ties. This may change alignments (not
	distances) when ties are present.

1.16-1
	Added countPaths, store window function

1.16
	Version bump

1.15-4
	Changed to .Call interface

1.15-3

1.15-2
	Added property for stepsTaken (backtrack results)

1.15-1
	Fixed warnings in current R checks

1.14-2
	Fixed pkg link error

1.14-1
	Added vignette and references to JSS paper

1.13-1
	Ported to NAMESPACE

1.12-6
	Fixed warnings

1.9-2
	Fixed bug in partial w/ norm=M

1.9-1
	Fixed plot documentation

1.8-3
	Improved plot parameters, add match.index

1.8-2
	Added transpose step pattern

1.8-1
	Added MVM step pattern

1.7-2
	Added inputs in dtw object if keep=T. Plots honor them.

1.7-1
	Implemented all Rabiner-Huang step patterns,
	autogenerated. Step plot now has labels.

1.6-1
	Fix plotting of three-way: reverse axis, partial
	Implement & document partial option
	Handle ts, mts objects

1.5-3
	Fix malloc.h for OSX build
